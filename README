PATHFINDING DEMO

Author: Ivica Gunjaca
Language: C

Description: 
This is a short program demonstrating pathfinding using Breadth
First Search in an unweighted graph represented as a 2D aray of integers.
Value 0 in the array represents a node of the graph and the value 1 represents
an obstacle. Because a 2D array is used, the node has a maximum of 8
neighbours (the surrounding cells in the 2D array).

Compilation:
The glib2-devel package is a prerequisite for the program to compile.
During development, I used the following to compile: 

gcc -Wall `pkg-config --libs --cflags glib-2.0` Pathfinding.c

This way, all the required glib2 headers and libraries are included.
